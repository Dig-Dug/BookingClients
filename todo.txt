Next natural steps 🚀

Now that the core is working, we can build on it slowly:

Add Update + Delete endpoints

So you can do full CRUD (not just create/get).

Validation

e.g. don’t allow empty Title or Author.

DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

So your API doesn’t expose EF models directly.

Swagger UI

For a built-in testing interface (instead of just Postman).
