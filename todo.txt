Next natural steps 🚀

Now that the core is working, we can build on it slowly:



/**

Phase 1 – Stabilize & Clean

✅ Validation: ensure Title and Author aren’t empty.

✅ DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): avoid exposing EF models directly.

✅ Swagger UI: built-in testing interface, so you don’t need Postman for everything.

Goal: API is safe, clean, and easy to test.

Phase 2 – CRUD Enhancements

✅ Update & Delete endpoints (done).

✅ Proper HTTP response codes (404 when item not found, 400 for validation errors).

✅ Optional: timestamps for created/updated.

Goal: Complete RESTful API behavior.

/**

Phase 3 – Query & Filter Enhancements

✅ Filtering with query parameters (author, title, year).

✅ Pagination (page, pageSize) using LINQ Skip() and Take().

✅ Optional: sorting by field (e.g., Title ASC/DESC).

Goal: API can handle larger datasets efficiently.

Phase 4 – Security

✅ Authentication with JWT: users log in, get a token, secure endpoints.

✅ Role-based authorization (optional, e.g., admin vs. normal users).

✅ HTTPS enforcement & CORS policies.

Goal: Only authorized users can modify data.

Phase 5 – Front-End Integration

✅ Minimal front-end (React or Blazor) that consumes your API.

✅ Use forms for Add/Edit, list for Display, Delete buttons, etc.

✅ Optional: client-side validation to complement server-side validation.

Goal: Full-stack application where users can interact with the API visually.

Phase 6 – Advanced & Extras

✅ Swagger enhancements: XML comments, response descriptions.

✅ Testing: unit tests for services, integration tests for controllers.

✅ Optional features: search suggestions, CSV import/export, or book cover images.

Goal: Production-ready, maintainable, and testable app.
